## CheckForRepeats.py
Quick-and-dirty script to check for repeats in sam file (dupicate mappings). Prints names and locations of repeated sequences or "No repeats found".

Limitations: This implementation assumes that when the sam file was generated, the oligos were given to bwa in order, so any repeats will be consecutive. By checking neighboring lines only, the program can run in O(n) instead of O(n^2).

Example command:
```
python3 CheckForRepeats.py filename.sam
```

### Test Case
Running on `positive_control.sam` should find repeats, while running on `negative_control.sam` should find none. Both files are from a map of oligos generated by GetOligos.py back to the [maize reference genome](https://www.maizegdb.org/assembly).
